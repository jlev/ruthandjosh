<h3>Ceremony</h3>
<p>Ruth and Josh will be wed by the Bay at 4 PM on Saturday, June 29 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_and_Hilarita_Lyford_House">the Lyford House</a> in Tiburon, California. Their mutual friend Zachary Ozer, who became ordained as an American Marriage Minister for the occasion, will officiate. Ruth will be flanked by her Maid of Honor, Maude David, and bridesman, Adam Beerman. Josh will be joined by his Best Man, Jared Malsin, and his groomsmaid and sister, Hannah Levinger.</p>

<p>Guests are invited to arrive at the Lyford House as early as 3 o'clock to kick off the celebration with conversation and drinks, or to explore the surrounding bird sanctuary and beach.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>A reception and dinner on site will immediately follow the ceremony. While the site is transitioned, guests are invited to enjoy appetizers and drinks on the patio of the Lyford House. In addition to other appetizers, <a href="http://www.theoystergirls.com/" target="_blank">the Oyster Girls</a> will be on hand to shuck fresh local oysters. The beverage selection will include homebrewed beer from the Brew Master of Honor, a friend of the couple, as well as soft drinks, whiskey, and local wine.</p>
 
<p>As the evening transitions to dinner, local musicians will provide new entertainment.
After the toasts, dancing, and cupcakes from Oakland-based <a href="http://angelcakessf.com/" target="_blank">Angel Cakes</a>, guests will be asked to transition to the after party at the <a href="http://millvalleybeerworks.com/" target="_blank">Mill Valley Beer Works</a>.</p>

<h3>The Night Before</h3>

<p>Given the long travel distance required for some guests, and the short distance for others, everyone is invited to happy hour in Mill Valley the night before the wedding. This location will be announced closer to the date.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>We encourage carpooling; let us know if you are interested. The venues are all located along flat bike routes.</p>
<p>Note that the last San Francisco-bound ferry will depart Tiburon at 6:30 pm. Please check the
<a href="http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com/ferry-services/ferry-schedules/">Blue and Gold schedule</a> if you plan on using the ferry.


<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
 
<p><b>What is the dress code?</b> Official answer: Californian outdoor-friendly semi-formal. The ceremony and festivities all will be outside, so ladies should consider the prospect of walking on soft ground when selecting shoes (dancing will be on a brick patio). There are short trails and a beach on the site, so be prepared and wear something a little more comfortable if you'd like to go exploring. We'll keep an eye on the forecast, but expect a lot of lovely California sunshine.</p> 

<p><b>Children and plus ones?</b> Children are  welcome to the ceremony and reception. There's plenty to see and explore, so they should have a good time. Bring your serious-ish significant other if you've got one.</p>

<p><b>I am allergic to ___. Will you have anything for me to eat?</b> Yes. We are already aware of some gluten allergies, and will have plenty of gluten-free and vegetarian options. Note your needs on the RSVP form, and we'll make sure you're covered.</p>

<p><b>Your drawings and website are so cute; who made them?</b>Josh built the website from scratch in a day, and Ruth drew all the images by hand. This collaborative creative process proves that waiting until you both get masters degrees before getting married is a smart move.</p>
