<h3>Friday: The Day Before</h3>

<p>Given the long travel distance required for some guests, and the short distance for others, everyone is invited to happy hour in Mill Valley the night before the wedding at Piazza D’Angelo Ristorante from 8 to 11 pm.</p>

<h3>Saturday: Ceremony</h3>

<p>Ruth and Josh will be wed by the Bay at 4 PM on Saturday, June 29 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_and_Hilarita_Lyford_House">the Lyford House</a> in Tiburon, California. Their mutual friend Zachary Ozer, who became ordained as an American Marriage Minister for the occasion, will officiate. Ruth will be flanked by her Maid of Honor, Maude David, and bridesman, Adam Beerman. Josh will be flanked by his Best Man, Jared Malsin, and his groomsmaid and sister, Hannah Levinger.</p>

<p>Guests are invited to arrive at the Lyford House as early as 3 o'clock to kick off the celebration with conversation and drinks, or to explore the surrounding bird sanctuary and beach.</p>

<h3>Immediately Afterward: Reception</h3>

<p>A reception and dinner on site will immediately follow the ceremony. While the site is transitioned, guests are invited to enjoy appetizers and drinks on the patio of the Lyford House. In addition to other appetizers, <a href="http://www.theoystergirls.com/" target="_blank">the Oyster Girls</a> will be on hand to shuck fresh local oysters. The beverage selection will include homebrewed beer from the Brew Master of Honor Kenton Hokanson, as well as soft drinks, whiskey, and local wine.</p>
 
<p>As the evening transitions to dinner, <a href="http://hoteinstein.com/">Hot Einstein</a> will provide lively entertainment and a hearty dose of the Talking Heads.

After the toasts, dancing, and cupcakes from West Oakland-based <a href="http://angelcakessf.com/" target="_blank">Angel Cakes</a>, guests will be asked to transition to the after party at the <a href="http://millvalleybeerworks.com/" target="_blank">Mill Valley Beer Works</a>.</p>

<h3>Sunday: The Next Day</h3>

<p>Our parents are graciously hosting a jazz brunch at Sweetwater Music Hall from 10 am to noon, Sunday June 30. If you will still be in town and would like another chance to mingle with delightful company over wonderful food, please <a href="mailto:us@ruthandjosh.net">RSVP</a> to us by May 31.</p>

<p>Josh’s cousin Anna owns and operates a 2.5 acre <a href="http://goldennectar.com/">organic farm</a> in Windsor, about an hour north of Tiburon. She invites all of our guests to join her, three very happy ducks, and a zillion blueberry bushes for an informal tour Sunday afternoon from 2-5 pm.
