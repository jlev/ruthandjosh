<h3>Ceremony</h3>
<p>Ruth and Josh wed by the Bay at 4 PM on Saturday, June 29 at the Lyford House in Tiburon, California. Their mutual friend Zachary Ozer, who became ordained as an American Marriage Minister for the occasion, will officiate. Ruth will be flanked by her Maid of Honor, Maude David, and bridesman, Adam Beerman. Josh will be joined by his Best Man, Jared Malsin, and his groomsmaid and sister, Hannah Levinger.</p>

<p>Guests are invited to arrive at the Lyford House as early as 3 o'clock to kick off the celebration with conversation and drinks, or to explore the surrounding bird sanctuary and beach.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>A reception and dinner on site will immediately follow the ceremony. While the site is transitioned, guests are invited to enjoy appetizers and drinks on the patio of the Lyford House. In addition to other appetizers, <a href="http://www.theoystergirls.com/" target="_blank">the Oyster Girls</a> will be on hand to shuck fresh local oysters. The beverage selection will include homebrewed beer from the Brew Master of Honor, a friend of the couple, as well as soft drinks, whiskey, and local wine.</p>
 
<p>As the evening transitions to dinner, local musicians will provide new entertainment. After the toasts, dancing, and cupcakes from Oakland-based <a href="http://angelcakessf.com/" target="_blank">Angel Cakes</a>, guests will be asked to transition to the after party at the <a href="http://millvalleybeerworks.com/" target="_blank">Mill Valley Beer Works</a>.</p>

<h3>The Night Before</h3>

<p>Given the long travel distance required for some guests, and the short distance for others, everyone is invited to happy hour in Mill Valley the night before the wedding. This location will be announced closer to the date.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>We encourage carpooling; let us know if you are interested. The venues are all located along flat bike routes.</p>
<p>Note that the last San Francisco-bound ferry will depart Tiburon at 6:30 pm. Please check the
