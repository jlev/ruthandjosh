<h4>I live in San Francisco or the East Bay. Should I get a hotel in Marin?</h4>
<p>A cab between Tiburon and the Mission runs about $55 ($75 to Downtown Oakland). This will be less than any hotel nearby.</p>

<h4>Who can I split a cab with?</h4>
<p>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PHXvGAP6BkA_diRWpHqKL1wqM8uw5Ppk_vDfgkJREfs/viewform">this form</a> to find potential ride shares within our guest list.</p>

<h4>What is the dress code?</h4> <p>Official answer: Californian outdoor-friendly semi-formal. The ceremony and festivities all will be outside, so ladies should consider the prospect of walking on soft ground when selecting shoes (dancing will be on a brick patio). There are short trails and a beach on the site, so be prepared and wear something a little more comfortable if you'd like to go exploring. We'll keep an eye on the forecast, but expect a California sunshine and cool air at night.</p> 

<h4>Children and plus ones?</h4> <p>Children are  welcome to the ceremony and reception. There's plenty to see and explore, so they should have a good time. Bring your serious-ish significant other if you've got one.</p>

<h4>I am allergic to ___. Will you have anything for me to eat?</h4> <p>Yes. We are already aware of some gluten allergies, and will have plenty of gluten-free and vegetarian options. Note your needs on the RSVP form, and we'll make sure you're covered.</p>

<h4>Your drawings and website are so cute; who made them?</h4> <p>Josh built the website from scratch in a day, and Ruth drew all the images by hand. This collaborative creative process proves that waiting until you both get masters degrees before getting married is a smart move.</p>
