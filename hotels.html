		<h3>Weather</h3>
		<p><i>The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.</i> Commonly attributed to Mark Twain, this is a Bay Area resident's favorite and least helpful piece of advice for an unprepared and miserably cold toursit. "Summer in California" sounds warm, and the sky may be blue, but it will be cold. Check the forecast and bring a jacket.</p>

		<h3>Hotels</h3>
		<p>The <a href="http://www.marinhotels.com/mill-valley-inn/home" target="_blank">Mill Valley Inn</a> is an upscale hotel in the center of walkable downtown Mill Valley, near several shops and restaurants, and adjacent to a brewery, which will host the post-reception after party. It requires a two-night stay.</p>
		<p><a href="http://lodgeattiburon.com/" target="_blank">The Lodge at Tiburon</a> is also a nice hotel, but more affordable, does not require a two-night stay, and is closer to the wedding venue.</p>
